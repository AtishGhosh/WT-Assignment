<h1 style="color:red;">String Buffer & Methods</h1>
</p>
<strong>StringBuffer</strong> is a peer class of String that provides much of the functionality of strings. <br>String represents fixed-length, immutable character sequences while StringBuffer represents growable and writable character sequences.
</p>
<p>
<strong>StringBuffer</strong> may have characters and substrings inserted in the middle or appended to the end.<br> It will automatically grow to make room for such additions and often has more characters preallocated than are actually needed, to allow room for growth.
</p>
<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>Some of the most used methods are:</p>
<p><strong>•length( ) and capacity( ):</strong> The length of a StringBuffer can be found by the length( ) method, <br>while the total allocated capacity can be found by the capacity( ) method.<br>Code Example:</p>
<pre>
Import java.io.
class GFG
public static void main(String[]
StringBuffer s = new StringBu:
int p = s.length();
int q = s.capacity(); System.out.printlnMength of System.out.println(.Capacity
<strong>Output:</strong>
Length of string GeeksforGeeks.13 Capacity of string GeeksforGeeks.29

</pre>
<pre>
<strong>•append(,):</strong> It is used to add text at the end of the existence text.<br> Here are a few of its forms:<br>
StringBuffer append(String str) of this sequence.
Syntax:
public CharSequence subSequence(int start,
                                               int end)


</pre>
<pre>
<strong>•String  substring(int start):</strong> This method returns a new String that contains a subsequence of characters currently contained in this character sequence. <br>Syntax:
<br>public String substring(int start)
<br>public String substring(int start,
<br>int end)
<strong>•String  toString():</strong> This method returns a string representing the data in this sequence.<br>
Syntax:
public String tostring()
<strong>•void trimToSize():</strong> This method attempts to reduce storage used for the character sequence.
Syntax:
public void trimToSize()
